# statictesting
This is a MATLAB program designed to process static testing data by plotting the stress-strain graph, and extracting mechanical properties data such as Young's Modulus, Yield Strength, Ultimate Tensile Strength, and Breaking Strain.

The input data is .txt or .dat file with the following format:
- Tab separated value
- 4 coloumns as provided from the testing machine: [Time(s)]  [Displacement(mm)]  [Force(kN)] [Strain(microstrain)]
example:

Hope this helps! This is an old project, so I might be a bit rusty. For questions just hit me with an email.

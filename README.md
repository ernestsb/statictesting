# statictesting
This is a MATLAB program designed to process static testing data by plotting the stress-strain graph, and extracting mechanical properties data such as Young's Modulus, Yield Strength, Ultimate Tensile Strength, and Breaking Strain.

This is an automated program which inputs and process a batch of files at the same time, but you can modify it to process a single file.

The input data is .txt or .dat file with the following format:
- Tab separated value
- 4 coloumns as provided from the testing machine: [Time(s)]  [Displacement(mm)]  [Force(kN)] [Strain(microstrain)]

example provided in example_input.dat


Hope this helps! This is an old project, so I might be a bit rusty. For questions just hit me with an email.
